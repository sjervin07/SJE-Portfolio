        <p>Hello There!</p>
        <p>My name is Shannon Ervin, and I am a persuing a new career as a full-stack web devloper. After years of working with children on the Autism spectrum as a Line Therpaist, and later in hospital administration- I desired a change. Over the last year or two I came to realize that I really enjoyed helping to re-develop order sets for the Electronic Health Records system at my job in a hospital. That, combined with the fact that I love problem solving a good puzzle, led me to web development. With a field so wide-open to possibilities, I am confidnent that I will find my niche in an area that will not only be personally satifsfying but will also allow me to make a wider impact that reaches beyond myself.</p>
        <p>On a personal side, I have a lot of varying interests when it comes to hobbies and things that I like to do for fun. I'm a big traveler and try to make one national and one international trip every year...if finances allow! My goal is to hit six of the seven continents (haven't decided on whether I want to go for Antarctica) and I've hit 4 so far. Apart from traveling, I love going to movies, researching random topics at 3:00 am and listening to true crime podcasts.</p>
